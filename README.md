# Getting started with Go, Gin, Templ, and HTMX
## Motivation
Being late on the hypetrain, I still wanted to expand my toolset.
This is my progress of learning a new techstack, one that focuses on performance (as they promise).
And I just love the HATEOAS concept, so I gave it a shot.
This might be the techstack for light-medium interaction UI and performant backend.
## Conclusion
This is a successful study of the techstack.
Further improvement on the stack would be TailwindCSS.
With further practice, this can be my main way to develop most of the sites. Especially for prototyping.
